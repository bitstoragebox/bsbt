The non-fungible token NFT is expected to continuously growing due to the combination of the 
current and new trends such as the metaverse. Metaverse is a compound word of 'Meta' meaning 
abstraction and 'Universe' meaning the real world, it refers to moving the real space to digital as 
it is. Recently, due to the spread of COVID-19, games using the metaverse have emerged. 
Strategy Analytics (SA), a market research firm, predicts that the ‘metaverse economy’ 
represented by VR and AR will grow to $280 billion (314.58 trillion won) by 2025, more than six 
times the current level.
In this metaverse space, NFT is a tool used as the value of goods. For example, in Decentraland, a 
game based on blockchain and metaverse, land is an NFT. Users who own land can also build 
buildings. Since NFTs are scarce, land is very valuable, you can also sell lands in game. Similarly, in 
the blockchain-based game ‘The Sandbox’, the real estate ‘LAND’ in the game is an NFT, Currently, 
LAND continues to sell out every sales period.
As such, NFT is used in games, movies, music, digital art, and various industries, and is expected 
to grow rapidly.
In the ‘BSB Quiz World’ metaverse, anyone can build their own unique quiz city through NFT. 
Through it, you can expand your city by realizing the interests of yourself and the participants. 
Anyone can issue their avatar card as NFT and sell it on the market, and if there is something 
valuable, you can issue it as a new NFT and trade in B2B. As such, the final goal of the BSBT 
project is to build an NFT-based BSB quiz world in a virtual space called 'BSB Quiz World Metaverse'.
